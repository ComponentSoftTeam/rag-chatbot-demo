Mistral,mistral-large,"[[""What is 5G?"",""Based on the context provided, 5G is the fifth generation of wireless broadband technology for cellular networks. It is expected to provide an enhanced mobile broadband targeting peak data rates of up to 20 Gbps, extend 4G's Internet of Things capability, and enable mission-critical applications that require ultra-high reliability and low latency. 5G networks are designed by taking a user-centric approach. The \""G\"" in 5G stands for \""GENERATION\"". Each generation of wireless broadband is defined as a set of telephone network standards that describe the technological implementation of the system. 5G is set to provide speeds of up to 10 Gbps, and with its low latency feature, it is estimated to be 60 to 120 times faster than the average 4G latency.""],[""MI az előnye az 5Gnek a 4Ghez képest?"",""Based on the context provided, the advantage of 5G over 4G is that it is expected to provide an enhanced mobile broadband targeting peak data rates of up to 20 Gbps, extend 4G's Internet of Things capability, and enable mission-critical applications that require ultra-high reliability and low latency. 5G networks are designed by taking a user-centric approach.
